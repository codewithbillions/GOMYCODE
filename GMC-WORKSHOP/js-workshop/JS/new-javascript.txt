lesson 1

inpect page and view console.

alert("hello")
document.body.innerHTML = "hello".

javascript is basically giving instructions to a computer.

lesson 2 
numbers and math
in the console

2 + 2 press enter
10 - 3
10 * 3
10 / 2
2.2 + 2.2

order of operations also called (operation precedence in js)
* / are done first
+ - are done after

* / also have the same priority
it will calculate from left to right
2 * 3 / 5

+ - also have the same priority

2 + 3 - 5
it will calculate from left to right

another order of operation is that we can use bracket () to control which part gets done first.

1 + 1 * 3

now run

(1 + 1) * 3

in this case the calculation in the bracket will be done first

brackets are the highest priority in the order of operations.

--------------------------
weird behaviour of math in javascript.

in programming:
integers : 2, 3, 5
floating point numbers or floats: 2.2, 3.4 etc.

unfortunately computer have a problem working with floats

0.1 + 0.2 
= 0.30000000000000000004

it is a little bit inaccurate.
many programming language has this problem. the reason this happens is because of the way computer stores numbers.

explanation:
computer can only store => 0, 1
humans => 0, 1, 2, 3, .....8,9.
so there is a mismatch between our numbers system.

because computer stores in binary, it becomes an issue to store with float but this doesnt happen for all floats 
for example

computers can store 0.25 without any problem.

>>>rounding a number means taking a number and moving it to the nearest integer.

Math.round()

Math.round(2.2)
Math.round(2.8)

calculate i cent
((2095 + 799) * 0.1) / 100

we get 2.894

Math.round((2095 + 799) * 0.1) / 100
